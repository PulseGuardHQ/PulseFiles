-- Fix user_id column to support Clerk user IDs (with policy handling)
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor

SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'shared_files' AND column_name = 'user_id';

-- Drop dependent policies first
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their own files" ON shared_files;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view logs for their files" ON file_access_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their own folder contents" ON folder_contents;

-- Now drop the existing user_id column if it exists and is UUID type
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    -- Check if column exists and is UUID type

        ALTER TABLE shared_files DROP COLUMN user_id;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_shared_files_user_id ON shared_files(user_id);

-- Recreate policies with TEXT user_id (but simplified for Clerk)
-- Note: These policies assume you're using Clerk authentication
-- For now, we'll create simpler policies that work with external auth

-- Policy for shared_files: Allow users to manage files (simplified)
-- This policy is more permissive since we're using external auth (Clerk)
